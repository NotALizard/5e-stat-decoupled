The target must be within 5 feet of you and no more than one size larger than you. Unless it succeeds on a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, you push it up to 10 feet away from you. @Compendium[5e-stat-decoupled.abilities.SL6OC5ZJ4ZC5O56H]{Hammering Horns}</p>",
