Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is &ldquo;trance.&rdquo;) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. @Compendium[5e-stat-decoupled.abilities.Q5DA9NC8HR3BFDL8]{Trance}</p><p><strong>Darkvision.</strong>&nbsp;You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. @Compendium[5e-stat-decoupled.abilities.EXHZKP41HJVW4RRK]{Darkvision}</p><p><strong>Subrace.</strong>&nbsp;You get a subrace.</p><h3>Drow*</h3><p><strong>Daylight Sensitive.</strong>&nbsp;You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. @Compendium[5e-stat-decoupled.abilities.HI432Q4NOY2SSWPK]{Daylight Sensitive}</p><p><strong>Drow Magic.</strong>&nbsp;You know the&nbsp;<em>dancing lights</em>&nbsp;cantrip.

You can cast the chosen spell once without expending a spell slot and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, the chosen spell is cast as a 2nd-level spell.
