You have a number of these dice equal to your proficiency bonus (these dice are added to any Psionic Energy dice you have from another source), and they fuel various psionic powers you have, which are detailed below.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy die they use, as specified in a power&rsquo;s description, and you can&rsquo;t use a power if it requires you to use a die when your dice are all expended. You regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish a long rest.</p>",
