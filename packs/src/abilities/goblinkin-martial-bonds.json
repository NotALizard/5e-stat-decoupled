You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting at 3rd level, your help confers additional benefits. Choose one of the options below each time you take the Help action, whether as a bonus action or an action:<ul><li><strong><em>Hospitality.</em></strong>&nbsp;You and the target of your Help action each gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d6 plus your proficiency bonus.</li><li><strong><em>Passage.</em></strong>&nbsp;You and the target of your Help action can each immediately move 10 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity and at no movement cost. A creature does not gain this benefit if it has a condition that reduces its speed to 0 or prevents movement.</li><li><strong><em>Dominance.</em></strong>&nbsp;Within the next minute, the first attack against you and the target of your Help action are both made at disadvantage.</li></ul></p>",
