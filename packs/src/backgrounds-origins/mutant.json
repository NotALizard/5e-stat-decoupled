Maybe one of your parents was a lycanthrope or other magical creature and you were born with your mutation. It could be that you drank an unlabelled potion you found in an abandoned hut. Regardless of your story, you might decide to try and hide your unnatural features or bear them proudly despite the repercussions.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong>&nbsp;Your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution increases by 1.</p><p><strong>Natural Weapon.</strong>&nbsp;You have a natural weapon that deals 1d6 damage. You must decide during character creation what form this weapon takes, whether it uses Strength or Dexterity, and whether the damage is bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or poison. Some examples are claws, a set of horns, a tail, sharp teeth, or a poisonous stinger. If you choose claws, each hand counts as a separate weapon but your hand must be free to attack with it. @Compendium[5e-stat-decoupled.abilities.YQZQKUT4DQFOBX6X]{Natural Weapon}</p><p><strong>Skills.</strong>&nbsp;Choose one from: Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Intimidation, Perception, Survival.</p><p><strong>Tools.</strong>&nbsp;You gain proficiency with the Disguise Kit or alchemist&rsquo;s supplies.</p><p><strong>Languages.</strong>&nbsp;Common, plus one of your choice.</p>",
